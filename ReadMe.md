# 1. The concept

The goal of this project is the automated control of the dynamic lighting of an architectural structure composed by LED stripes: this is done by a plug-in which analyzes the mixer-output audio signal in real-time.

# 2. Plugin Interface
![gif](images/interface.gif)
The Plug-in is all made by using the C++ JUCE application framework
# 3. The Algorithm
##  3.1 Beat Tracking algorithm

# 4. Feature extraction phase
##  4.1 Panning
##  4.2 Audio Spectral Centroid
##  4.3 Velocity

# 5. Lights' animation 
##  5.1 Rules for animations' choice
##  5.2 Animations management

# 6.The rendering phase: 3D Mapper + Plugin
